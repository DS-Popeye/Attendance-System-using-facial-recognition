# Project: Face Recognition and Identification system 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱

The project is called Attendance System using facial recognition. The goal of the project is to identify the person 
and mark their attendance. First, the user has to register himself/herself in the application providing the required details. 
The application takes multiple snaps of the user and then stores it into the database. Once the same user comes before the 
camera again, the application captures the image, references it against the already stored images in the database, and then 
marks the attendance, if the user is present in the database. Reports can be generated for a particular duration based on 
the user requirement.
